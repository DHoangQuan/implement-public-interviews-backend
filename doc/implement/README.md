# Mamo Pay - Backend Challenge

Something that I do in this implementation:

converted parameters from camelcase to snakecase before the requests go to the controller in wrap_parameters.rb

Money-rails were used to set currency, and future scaling can be used to exchange money rates or something related to money.

8 Api was written for this challenges includes:

   - create account

   - get list account

   - verified account

   - unverified account

   - withdraw balance

   - deposit balance

   - balance transfer (single API, but support for finding recipients by ID, phone, and email)

   - get history transfer
